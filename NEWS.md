# fireworks 0.1.1

* Added a `fadeOut` argument to the `stop` method to control whether the fireworks fade out or disappear instantly. The effects lasts 2000 ms to remove the fireworks in a natural manner. Thanks to @laresbernardo for the suggestion in issue #1. Example can be found in `inst/examples/02-fireworks-on-demand.R`.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
